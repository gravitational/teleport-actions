## Introduction

`teleport-actions` is a collection of handy GitHub Actions to use within your
workflows when trying to interact with resources protected by Teleport ðŸš€.

This project is currently experimental and more information about
`teleport-actions` will arrive soon.

## Actions

### `@gravitational/teleport-actions/setup`

`setup` installs key Teleport binaries into your workflow environment, for
example `tctl`, `tsh` and `tbot`. You can then use these within your workflows.

The GitHub Actions tool cache is used by the `setup` action in order to increase
setup speed and reduce bandwidth usage on self-hosted runners.

Usage:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Checkout repository
   uses: actions/checkout@v3
- name: Setup teleport
   uses: gravitational/teleport-actions/setup@v1
   with:
      # version must be specified, and exclude the "v" prefix.
      # check https://goteleport.com/download/ for valid releases.
      version: 10.3.1
```

## Developing

This guidance applies to engineers wishing to make changes to Teleport's
GitHub actions.

Until we build a CI/CD flow for producing the built actions, we have provided
a series of pre-commit hooks. These will ensure source files follow linter rules
and also ensure that the built version of the action is up to date. Follow the
quick-start instructions at <https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start> to install
the pre-commit hooks.

See the GitHub guidance for versioning:
<https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/action-versioning.md#recommendations>

In order to allow us to make fixes to older major versions, we maintain a
`branch/v${version}` which will diverge from `main`, with changes backported
from `main` to the appropriate version branch.
